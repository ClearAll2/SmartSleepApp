# Smart Sleep

Smart Sleep is an Android app that can calculate sleep cycle so you can estimate the time you need to go to bed or wake up. It has some extra features as well.

A good day starts with a good sleep. A good sleep should consist of 5-6 complete sleep cycles. To wake up refreshed, you need to sleep and wakeup at correct time.

Smart Sleep can calculate sleep cycle so you can estimate the time you need to go to bed or wake up. You don't need to open Clock app because you can set alarm right in Smart Sleep. This app can also help you fall asleep faster with nature and relaxation sounds.
