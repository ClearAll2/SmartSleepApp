# Terms of Service

This document details how you may use this website and our applications. Please read it carefully before using our website or applications, along with the [Privacy Policy](privacy.md). If you do not fully understand and agree to both this document (“Terms of Service”) and the Privacy Policy, you may not use any of our applications. We may also refer to this document as the End-User License Agreement.

The terms in this document apply to the following properties:
- This website (smartsleep.site)
- Smart Sleep app on Play Store
- Display Info app on Play Store

All content on this website and related properties is provided on an as-is basis without warranty of any kind. By using our application, you agree that we are not liable for any potential harm, damages, or other negative effects resulting from your use of applications. Use our applications at your own risk.

## Apps on Play Store

If you download our applications from the Google Play Store, you are granted a single license to the software for personal use only. This license is non-transferable and non-exclusive; you may not share your license for any of our applications with other users under any circumstances. You may, however, purchase multiple licenses that can be shared with others on a per-individual basis. In such cases, this agreement applies independently to each individual.

This applies regardless of how you obtained the application and whether you paid a monetary fee for the application. For example, if you were granted a license to the application free of charge through an official promotion, all of these terms still apply.

If you have multiple personal devices, you may use the software on all of them, as long as they are all personal devices — that is, you must physically own the devices and use them in a personal capacity. Sharing the content for other individuals to use on their own devices does not qualify and is considered a violation of these terms.

You may not redistribute, resell, sublicense, modify, decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise alter exclusive software. This agreement will terminate immediately if we become aware of such actions from you.

You are not assigned any ownership of the content or intellectual property and may only use the content in accordance with these terms.

Please note that you are responsible for any and all actions occurring under your account.

The software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. in no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.

We reserve the right to update these terms at any time without notice.
